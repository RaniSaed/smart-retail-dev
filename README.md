## ⚡ Quick Start (Development)

Get the Smart Retail Inventory System up and running for development purposes with these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/RaniSaed/smart-retail-dev.git](https://github.com/RaniSaed/smart-retail-dev.git)
    cd smart-retail-dev/backend
    ```

2.  **Set up Python Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py  # Application will be available at http://localhost:5000
    ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

For a more isolated and consistent environment, you can leverage Docker.

### Backend Only

Build and run the Flask backend in a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t rani19/backend .
docker run -p 5000:5000 rani19/backend
````

### Full Stack with Docker Compose

Deploy the entire application stack (backend, frontend, database, and pgAdmin) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## ⚙️ API Reference

The Smart Retail Inventory System exposes a comprehensive RESTful API for managing products and inventory.

### `/api/products`

| Method | Description                       |
| :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | Retrieve a list of all products.  |
| `POST` | Add a new product to the inventory. |

### `/api/products/<id>`

| Method   | Description                               |

| **Dashboards** | Grafana         | Provides interactive and insightful visual panels for all metrics. |
| **Alerts** | Alertmanager    | Manages and dispatches notifications (e.g., email) for critical alerts. |

-----

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

Automated continuous integration and deployment are handled by Jenkins, ensuring a smooth and efficient development workflow.

The `Jenkinsfile` defines the following stages:

1.  **Clone Repositories**: Clones both development (`smart-retail-dev`) and configuration (`smart-retail-config`) repositories.
2.  **Build Docker Image**: Constructs the Docker image for the application.
3.  **Push to Docker Hub**: Pushes the newly built image to Docker Hub (`rani19/backend`).
4.  **Update Kubernetes Manifests**: Modifies Kubernetes deployment configurations.
5.  **Commit & Push Changes**: Commits updated manifests and pushes them to the Git repository.
6.  **Trigger ArgoCD Sync**: Initiates an ArgoCD synchronization, leveraging GitOps principles for deployment.

  * Pipelines for both backend and frontend are located at:
      * `Jenkins_Backend/Jenkinsfile`
      * `Jenkins_Frontend/Jenkinsfile`
